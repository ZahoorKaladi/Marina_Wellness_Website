      <p class="mb-4">Last weekend, our team of dedicated doctors and volunteers set up a free health checkup camp in Saddar Town. The response from the community was tremendous, with over 500 people receiving free medical consultations, basic health screenings, and preventative care advice.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">We focused on checking for common ailments, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels. For many, this was their only access to a medical professional all year. Our mobile pharmacy provided free medication, and we also educated residents on the importance of hygiene and healthy living.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Our next community health drive is already being planned for Gulshan-e-Iqbal. Stay tuned for more details on how you can get involved!</p>
